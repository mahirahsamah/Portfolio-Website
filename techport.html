                    <p class = "blog-post__text1">My co-project manager and I came up with our app idea "StudyBuddy" at a hackathon. It was a learning-oriented project under the Aggie Coding Club, where we used Java for front-end UI design and Python/Google Cloud API for the back-end functionalities. This app allows students to take pictures of their hand-written notes, and it identifies only the highlighted words in that picture and make a flashcard of each word for the student via a web dictionary search. We worked with a team of ten students, and it was split into two, one sub-team worked on the front-end and the other on the back-end.</p>

                    <p class = "blog-post__text2"> I taught Engineering Mechanics to freshmen using self-made worksheets and teaching strategies. Having taken this class as a freshman, I would show my students how to effectively study, practice, and take notes to maximize their physics potential. I conducted sessions over Zoom three days a week, with an average of 15 students every session. SI leaders were required to make worksheets for every session, which put a sense of responsibility alongside academics on my shoulders. It was difficult to navigate both commitments at once, but I eventually found a balance and started enjoying my sessions. I would get to use different collaboration devices during my sessions to ensure that students were being active, and it always filled me with joy when they thanked me at the end of the sessions for helping them.</p>

                    <p class = "blog-post__text3"> This semester, I am participating in research with my Statistics professor, whose STAT 212 class I took last semester. One day, she said she needed some undergraduate students to participate in statistics research conducted by her since associate professors at Texas A&M are encouraged to collaborate with and present opportunities to undergraduate students. Since I had never participated in research and I was curious about data science, I thought this would be a great opportunity to see what research is like and connect with my professor and my potential teammates, possibly even gain a reference letter from her for my future career endeavors. I had a meeting with her over Zoom where I was asked about my interests and aspirations. I was incredibly excited when I found out that I had been selected, and now I can say that I am very glad I seized the opportunity.
